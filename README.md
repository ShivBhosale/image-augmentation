# image-augmentation
My simple light weight CLI for augmenting image datasets for my deep learning and ML experiments

# Usage
- To see the tool help enter "python3 imaug.py -h" on the terminal

- Open the config.json and put select the transformation you are interested in for augmentation

- For mass image augmentation, put images in "input" folder and expect the output in "out" folder

- The tool alternatively also accepts a single image path as in input for transformation. Transformation prefixes are decided internally.
